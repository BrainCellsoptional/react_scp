                Mankind in its present state has been around for a quarter of a
                million years, yet only a small fraction of that has been of any
                significance.
              </h3>
              <p>
                <br></br>
                So, what did we do for nearly 250,000 years? We huddled in caves
                and around small fires, fearful of the things that we didn't
                understand. It was more than explaining why the sun came up, it
                was the mystery of enormous birds with heads of men and rocks
                that came to life. So we called them "gods" and "demons", begged
                them to spare us, and prayed for salvation. In time, their
                numbers dwindled and ours rose. The world began to make more
                sense when there were fewer things to fear, yet the unexplained
                can never truly go away, as if the universe demands the absurd
                and impossible.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear. </strong>No
                one else will protect us, and we must stand up for ourselves.
                While the rest of mankind dwells in the light, we must stand in
                the darkness to fight it, contain it, and shield it from the
                eyes of the public, so that others may live in a sane and normal
                world.
